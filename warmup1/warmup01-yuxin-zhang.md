korean braised short ribs
-------------------------

**ingredients** - 1 yellow onion, peeled and cut into chunks - 1 Asian or Bosc pear, peeled and cut into chunks - 8 cloves garlic, peeled - 1-inch knob fresh ginger, peeled and chopped - 1/4 cup mirin (sweet rice wine) or apple juice - 6 tablespoons soy sauce - 1 teaspoon or more hot sauce, such as gochujang - Salt, to taste - 3 to 3 1/2 pounds boneless beef short ribs, rinsed and cut into 3-inch segments - 4 large carrots, peeled and cut into 1-inch pieces - 1 medium daikon, peeled and cut into 1-inch pieces - 1 tablespoon toasted sesame seeds (to garnish) - 2 scallions, thinly sliced on the diagonal (to garnish)

***special* kitchen tools** - slow-cooker - blender - electric multicooker

**the steps of the recipe**

1.  In an Instant Pot/electric multicooker: Arrange short rib pieces in a single layer. Pour blended sauce over, and stir to coat. Secure the lid and set the pressure release valve to Sealing. Select the Meat/Stew setting for 35 minutes at high pressure. When the timer goes off, you can perform a quick release by moving the pressure release valve to Venting, but do so with tongs or a spoon because the pressured steam release will absolutely burn your hand. Open the pot and add the carrots and daikon. Secure the lid on the pot again, and set the pressure release valve once again to Sealing. Select Cancel to reset the cooking program, then select the Manual program and set the cooking time for 3 minutes at high pressure. Perform another quick release when the time is up (moving the valve to Venting). Open the pot and use a slotted spoon to remove the meat and vegetables from the cooking liquid, then use a spoon or fat separator, if you have one, to skim as much of the fat as possible from the surface of the sauce. Taste the sauce for seasoning and adjust as needed, then spoon the sauce over the meat and vegetables. Garnish with sesame seeds and scallions.

2.  In the oven: Heat oven to 325 degrees F. Combine short rib pieces and blended sauce in a heavy casserole dish or Dutch oven. Cover tightly with foil and a tight-fitting lid, if you have one. Bake in oven for 3 hours total, but after 2 hours, add the carrots and daikon. To check for doneness, carefully remove the lid and foil (trapped steam can burn you) and pierce the meat with the tines of a fork or point of a knife; it should yield easily. Taste a bit you pull off if you??re not sure. Use a slotted spoon to remove the meat and vegetables from the cooking liquid, then use a spoon or fat separator, if you have one, to skim as much of the fat as possible from the surface of the sauce. Taste the sauce for seasoning and adjust as needed, then spoon the sauce over the meat and vegetables. Garnish with sesame seeds and scallions.

3.  To serve: We ate this with white rice, a quick cabbage salad (thinly sliced napa cabbage, grated carrots, and thinly sliced scallions dressed with rice vinegar, toasted sesame oil, red pepper flakes and salt to taste), and a quick cucumber salad (thinly sliced small cucumbers lightly marinated in rice vinegar, salt, a pinch of sugar, and pepper) and gochujang (Korean hot chili paste) on the side.

4.  Do ahead: Short ribs are so good the second and third days, if you have any chance to plan ahead, you should. They keep in the fridge, buried in their braising liquid, for 4 to 5 days. They??re also much easier to de-fat; it will solidify once chilled and be easy to remove before reheating.

Euclidean Distance
==================

**Definition** The **Euclidean distance** between points **p** and **q** is the length of the line segment connecting them
$$
\\overline{pq}
$$
.

In Cartesian coordinates, if **p** = (p1, p2,..., pn) and **q** = (q1, q2,..., qn) are two points in Euclidean n-space, then the distance (d) from **p** to **q**, or from **q** to **p** is given by the Pythagorean formula:

$$
d(p,q) =d(p,d)=\\sqrt\[2\]\[(q\_1-p\_1)^2+(q\_2-p\_2)^2+\\cdots+(q\_n-p\_n)^2)\]
= \\sqrt\[2\]\[\\sum\_{i=1}^n(q\_i-p\_i)^2\] 
$$

The position of a point in a Euclidean n-space is a Euclidean vector. So, **p** and **q** may be represented as Euclidean vectors, starting from the origin of the space (initial point) with their tips (terminal points) ending at the two points. The **Euclidean norm**, or **Euclidean length**, or **magnitude** of a vector measures the length of the vector:

$$
||p||=\\sqrt\[2\]\[p\_1^2+p\_2^2+\\cdots+p\_n^2\]=\\sqrt\[2\]\[p \\cdot p\]
$$
 where the last expression involves the dot product.
